# Lint and Format Code

Run code formatting and linting to ensure the codebase meets project quality standards.

## 🎯 What I'll do:

1. **🎨 Format Code**: Run `make fmt` to apply Go formatting standards
2. **🔍 Run Linter**: Execute `make lint` to check for code quality issues  
3. **📊 Report Results**: Show formatting and linting outcomes
4. **✅ Quality Check**: Confirm code meets project standards
